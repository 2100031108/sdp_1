 <h1>ABOUT US</h1><br>
 <p3>kl Bank has been in the service of the nation since pre-Independence times. Incorporated on April 23, 1931, as the Travancore kl Bank Limited, Nedumpuram under the Travancore Companies Regulation, 1916, the Bank was renamed as The KL Bank Limited in December 1949, under the stewardship of Late K.P.Our performance is built on the bedrock of a solid foundation established by focussing on digital for the past decade. Our leading-edge digital capabilities make us a sought-after Bank in the neo-banking space. Launch of digital products and digital marketing initiatives marked a strategic leap for the Bank to capitalise on the new realities more effectively, translating into 86% share of digital transactions. Our strategy and commitment to grow a secured credit portfolio, to pursue quality over quantity while ensuring our liabilities continue to be organic and granular helped us deliver on our capital conservation theme. We had to make some difficult choices that were necessary to realise our ambition as we commit to accelerating progress towards the goal of being the Most Admired Bank.</p3>
